							          "Summary"			
This research paper is all about the testing methods 
of mobile applications, a large-scale empirical study on
the design and effectiveness of test cases manually written
by developers and their goal of the empirical study is to check quality,
and effectiveness of test cases written by mobile developers.
According to this paper Software testing is one of the most relevant and 
well-established methods to control for source code quality and to 
enable the understandability of the functionalities being implemented 
in a system. This activity is even more pressing in the context of
mobile computing, where continuous releases of an app have
the high risk of introducing defects and decrease software reliability.
At the same time, the unique characteristics of mobile apps.
In this research paper an example is elaborated by researcher that 
the fact that users can interact via touch-screen and a number of
sensors, present brand new challenges for developers when testing
the source code of their applications.	
Their empirical study clearly reports that mobile applications are
not sufficiently tested, while GUI-related classes and storage of the
considered apps remain mostly untested. As for the test code design, 
They discovered that most of them are affected by some form of test methods, 
Finally, all the effectiveness measured are low, meaning that tests are likely
to have a poor fault detection capability.


					      'Research Methodology' 
They started to accumulate informtion that are gathered in 
this research paper from GITHUB repositories of open source apps,
clonned apps locally and performed an exhaustive search through their 
packages in order to extract classes having “Test” as prefix or suffix—note 
that search to classes explicitly using the JUnit framework.

						          'RESULTS'
In this paper, researcher investigated the characteristics of test suites 
written by developers of mobile applications under three perspectives:
(1) whether and to what extent these apps are tested and which kind of 
    tests are developed.
(2) what is the design quality of the test suites, in terms of code.
(3) what is the effectiveness of tests, the main results of this research 
    paper highlight that 59% of the considered apps have at least one test suite.
